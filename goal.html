    <p class="project-description">
      The goal setting app is powered by a React frontend and Flask backend. SQLAlchemy database
                            is used to store
                            user's goals. The backend uses sentiment analysis to get a numerical rating on the user's
                            journal entries. Users may also evaluate their progress on their goals which is ran by
                            OpenAI
                            API supported agent.

                            <br>

                            As user's increase the progress of their goals, the plant that corresponds to their goals
                            will grow accordingly.
                            <br>

                            User's can also chat with a virtual therapist bot which uses whisper and text-to-speech
                            libraries in python.
