    <p class="project-description">
      The purpose of this app was to aid in the trip planning process. Users can input travel location, date, purpose, and length of stay through an initial input screen. 
      If users are unsure about where they are traveling, they can also choose to chat with an AI agent to receive location recommendations. 
      The user will then move onto the chat page where they will receive an initial travel itinerary and have the option to chat with the agent to edit their itinerary.

When they are finished, they can view their itinerary on a final itinerary page. 
This page will also be stored in the app's "itinerary history" so users can refer to old itineraries if they like.
The user will receive flight and hotel suggestions as well on the final itinerary page, which is received from a Flask app that integrates a customized LangChain agent that I built.
 The app uses HTTP requests to get the necessary information. 
 <br>
 The app is not deployed on the app store, but we foresee that it could have a significant impact on those who enjoy travelling.
