    <p class="project-description">
      As a Texan in Ithaca, the northeast climate was unfamiliar, and I struggled to pick out outfits each day based on the weather report. 
      Thus, I built an app to aid in this. 
      <br>
      Upon downloading the app, users can enter their names and view a brief demo of how the app works.
After granting location permissions, users will receive an outfit suggestion alongside a weather forecast. 
Users can then select the wardrobe button to choose clothes from their closet to add to their current outfit on the main page. 
Users can also upload images of their clothes to their wardrobe. 
Users will also have the option to pre-plan outfits for vacation with the vacation button at the bottom of the main page. 
<br>
This app has helped me learn about frontend development for iOS apps and has helped me select several of my outfits.
